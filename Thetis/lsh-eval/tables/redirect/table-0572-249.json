Because of her ability, she has difficulty forming lasting human relationships. She becomes involved in a romantic relationship with a vampire, Bill, upon discovering that she can't read his mind. This relationship with a supernatural being causes controversy amongst the residents of her small town. Through Bill, she finds herself entering a world of creatures and supernatural conflict that surpasses even her worst nightmares. She has lived with her grandmother, Adele Stackhouse, since childhood, after the death of her parents. After Adele's death, Sookie inherits the home. It is revealed in Season 3 that Sookie is part faerie, a race of supernaturals who are widely believed to have been driven to extinction by vampires, who drained them of their blood to obtain the ability to walk in the sun. The faeries commonly refer to this as \"stealing their light\" and hence have a distinct fear and hatred of vampires. It is from the faeries that Sookie inherited her telepathic powers, magical light and apparently delicious tasting blood. Sookie comes into contact with a community of faeries living in a hidden world in Bon Temps and, after learning of Bill's betrayal at the end of Season 3, joins them in their magical world. She quickly learns their communication with her was a trick to keep all the humans with faery DNA in the faery world. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a few minutes, only to learn that a year has passed in the human world. Upon discovering a naked, wandering Eric, who had his memory wiped out by Antonia/Marnie, Sookie takes him in. They develop a relationship and Eric gradually falls in love with Sookie. Under Antonia/Marnie's control he tries to kill Bill, but Sookie uses her faerie light to stop him and remove the spell. When Tara, Holly, and the others at the Moon Goddess emporium are held captive near the end of season 4, Sookie brings Jason, Jesus, and Lafayette to save them. Their plan fails and only Jason escapes. The others eventually flee with the help of Sookie's faerie powers and brujo magic from Jesus. Unknown to the group, Marnie uses Lafayette's medium ability to inhabit his body, after which she kills Jesus for his magic and attempts to kill Bill and Eric. Holly creates a safe circle and, with the help of Tara and Sookie, calls for friends, family members, and ancestors from beyond to help them. Sookie sees her Gran, Adele Stackhouse, and confesses she is lost without her. Gran tells her the answer is in her heart, and that there's no fear in being alone. After letting Bill and Eric feed from her to heal them, she breaks off her relationship with both vampires. She returns home where Debbie Pelt, who blames Sookie after being abjured by Alcide, is waiting with a shotgun. Tara jumps in the firing line and is shot in the head, after which Sookie fatally shoots Debbie. Season 5 begins Sookie and Lafayette reluctantly convincing Pam to turn Tara in to a vampire, a decision causes tension between Sookie and vampire hating Tara. Sookie is forced to tell Alcide the truth about his Debbie's death when the Pelt's come to Bon Temps in search of their daughter, but Alcide tells them it was Marcus Bosman who killed their daughter. After drowning her sorrows with alcohol, Sookie is visited by Alcide. He informs Sookie that he lied, meaning she is no longer a suspect in Debbie's death, and she responds by kissing him, oblivious to the fact that Bill and Eric are watching from outside. The two vampires eventually interrupt the couple to reveal that Russell Edgington is on the loose. Sookie uses her faerie power to help them find Russell's hiding place.

Shortly after, the Queen arrives at Bill's house in Bon Temps, expecting him to hand Sookie over. When he refuses, the two begin a duel to the death. By making a deal with Nan Flanagan, Bill has the Queen killed by snipers and becomes the new Vampire King of Louisiana. In early episodes it is revealed that Bill had a human wife and two children (Tom and Sarah) before he became a vampire. A short time after being turned Bill returns to his family in his desperation to see them one last time. He discovers that his son has recently died of an illness (pox). Upon seeing his tears of blood at the death of his son his wife becomes hysterical at which point Lorena, Bill's maker, steps in and glamors her before removing Bill from his family forever. The fates of Bill's wife and young daughter, who was not present during his return home, are unclear, although Adele Stackhouse makes reference to the recently deceased previous owner of Bill's family home as the last Compton in Bon Temps. In Episode 4 of the Fourth season, Bill becomes involved in a sexual relationship with Portia Bellefleur (sister of Sheriff Bellefleur) until, upon meeting her grandmother, he realises she is a descendant of his daughter Sarah.", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "Sam Merlotte", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Merlotte"]}, {"text": "Sam Trammell", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Trammell"]}, {"text": "1", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood_(season_1)"]}, {"text": "-", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "70", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "maenad", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad"]}, {"text": "maenad", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad"]}, {"text": "maenad", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad"]}, {"text": "maenad", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad"]}, {"text": "maenad", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maenad"]}], [{"text": "Jason Stackhouse", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Stackhouse"]}, {"text": "Ryan Kwanten", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Kwanten"]}, {"text": "1", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood_(season_1)"]}, {"text": "-", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "70", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "Jason Stackhouse is Sookie's not-too-bright, self-involved brother, who is vigilant in defending and protecting Sookie. He supervises a road crew during the day, and is known for bedding the women of Bon Temps at night. During the first season, he is the prime suspect in the murders of four women, all of whom have a connection to him. After the death of his V-addict girlfriend Amy, he comes to believe that he is responsible for the murders. He is then recruited by the Fellowship of the Sun, an anti-vampire church, who approve of what they believe to be his crime of killing fangbangers. In the second season, Jason briefly becomes an active member of the Fellowship, but later leaves it. In the third season, he develops a relationship with a supernatural creature, Crystal Norris, and thinks of joining the police. Crystal is forced to leave town with her fiance but Jason pledges to find her. Like his sister Jason is also part faerie though he does not appear to have inherited any of the special abilities that Sookie possesses. However, some speculate that his potential faerie \"ability\" is the sexual magnetism that many faeries possess. In fourth season he is a deputy on the Bon Temps police force and caretaker of the were-panthers of Hotshot. He is kidnapped by Felton & Crystal who are now V-addicts, and raped by all the women of the were-panther community after it is believed he is the \"ghost daddy\" meant to revive the dwindling numbers of the genetically weakened inbred pack. He manages to escape Hot Shot + Crystal, and kill Felton in the process, however due to the excessive, untreated bites from attempting to be turned werepanther by the others, he is left on the side of the road badly wounded. He is found by Jessica, where she tells him to \"drink\" and he is healed by her blood. When the witches cast a spell to bring the vampires out into the daylight, Jessica breaks free of her silver bonds and almost burns herself trying to walk out into the sunlight. Jason comes at the last second and tackles her back into the house, closing the door and saving her life. Jason starts having intermittent sexual fantasies about Jessica - some of which involving Hoyt. Jessica and Jason do finally have sex after she breaks up with Hoyt. In the culmination of season 4 when The Moon Goddess Emporium is being held captive by Marnie, Jason tries to save Sookie, Tara, and everyone else inside. When Pam angrily aims a bazooka at the place, and it blows up at the protective barrier Marnie has placed around the emporium, all vampires present (Eric, Bill, Pam, and Jessica) heal quickly - but Jason is left severely burned and blind. Jessica once again offers her blood and saves his life. He admits his feelings to Jessica, and she also admits her own. They agree to have a relationship - but just as friends with benefits. Jessica states that she just got out of her first and only serious relationship, and doesn't want to be tied down to anyone. With the season 5 premiere, Jason is greeted by Rev. Steve Newlin, who admits to Jason he's always had feelings for him. When Jason kindly rejects him, Newlin loses it and tries to bite Jason. Jessica rushes back and says \"Jason is mine\", then threates the Rev. with either leaving Jason alone - or the true death. Jason tries to cope with his feelings for Jessica in their casual relationship, and turns down advances from other girls despite his open relationship status. After running into his high school teacher, who it is revealed to have slept with an underage Jason, he struggles with his inner demons; saying that there is a big hole in him, with something just missing - and he's been trying to fill it with sex, which so far has worked - but now it is not.
