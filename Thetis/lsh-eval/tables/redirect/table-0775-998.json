She convinces a truck driver to give her a ride, only to then infect him, causing him to kill his wife with a hammer. Dean and Sam partner up with Bobby to track Eve down. Bobby goes to a crime scene only to see Rufus who is also working the job. As the four of them go to a warehouse they find Samuel Campbell with their cousin Gwen also on the trail. Soon they find out that a worm (that Eve spit into the truck driver's ear) inside people's heads is causing the killings and it's now in one of them. Dean gets infected and kills Gwen. As they sit down to think about how to kill this worm, Samuel leaves. Dean and Sam track down Samuel, who then attacks Dean with a concealed weapon; Sam kills Samuel. There is no sign of the worm leaving when Sam shot him, so Rufus and Bobby take off to get some \"tools\" from the car. As Rufus and Bobby try to open up Samuel's head to get the worm out he wakes up, and a fight breaks out while the brothers watch, locked out of the room. Samuel is electrocuted and the worm escapes him. Just in time, Sam and Dean kick into the room. They all agree to electrocute each other to find out who has the worm. Bobby has the worm and kills Rufus with a knife. The brothers tie Bobby up and torture him until the worm is flushed out dead, before that the worm tells them a message from Eve, that they were lured to the cannery and that they will all die.
