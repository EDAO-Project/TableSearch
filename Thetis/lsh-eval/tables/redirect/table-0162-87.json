While working on the case, they share a kiss and Morgan later tells Mick that she is perfect for him, not Beth. After Mick saves her life from a speeding car, Morgan goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up. Mick joins her in the shower and finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder, revealing her identity as Coraline. When Beth learns that Morgan is really Coraline, and the lady who kidnapped her when she was a little girl, she goes to Mick's apartment and stabs her through the heart with a wooden stake, not realizing that she has somehow become human again.", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "10", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "\"Sleeping Beauty\"", "isNumeric": false, "links":
