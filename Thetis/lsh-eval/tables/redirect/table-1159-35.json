The church reopened in 1955 and shortly after this Robinson executed the Tyndale and Bunyan windows. These face each other at each end of the transept. In the centre of the Bunyan window is the standing figure of John Bunyan, carrying a volume of \"Pilgrims Progress\". Underneath are the words \"John Bunyan 1628-1688\". He is surrounded by eight smaller lights. At the bottom left, we see Christian leaving the City of Destruction at the beginning of his pilgrimage. As he walks, he is immersed in reading a book. Around the upper half of the panel are the words: \u201cGraceless goes the way of destruction\u201d. In the background can be seen a distant city, with the word \"Destruction\" on a building. In a scroll over and around Christian are the words \u201cWhat shall I do to be saved?\u201d To the right of the above, we see Christian being pulled out of the Slough of Despond. Ahead is a winding road leading to a wall with a portal whose gates are closed. Underneath are the words: \"The name of the slough was Despond\". In the next panel, Christian kneels before the symbol of the cross and as he does so the burden on his back falls away. Over his head are words \u201cHe hath given me life by his death\u201d. Next we are told, \u201cHe espied two lions in the way\u201d, and we see the lions lying threateningly in wait. The inscription reads \u201cDifficulty is behind. Fear is before\u201d. Christian, his sword in his hand, next encounters the fearsome Apollyon. Underneath are the words \u201cApollyon straddled the whole way\u201d. The final three lights are interrelated. Across the base of all three run the words \"Blessed are they that do his commandments that they may enter in through the gates of the city\". The first and third lights each feature three seraphs with trumpets. Those on the left have scrolls proclaiming \u201cHoly Holy Holy\u201d, and on the far right \u201cis the Lord\u201d. A long beam of light leads up into the apex of the window, symbolising presumably the Celestial City and between the above two another light depicts two angelic figures, lifting two pilgrims from a river, each of whom carries in his hand a rolled scroll. The church\u2019s Tyndale window is of three lights and has eight scenes relating to Tyndale's life grouped around a central figure of Tyndale himself. Each scene has an explanatory caption. In the first light on the left hand side of the window there is a fortress or castle, on a hill at the top of the light and underneath are the words- \"I will cause a boy that driveth the plough shall know more of the Scriptures than thou\". Beneath this we have a picture of Tyndale and a priest with the caption \u201cTyndale at Little Sodbury\u201d. In the next and middle light of the window there is at the top a jewel-shaped decoration and under this is a scene featuring Bristol Cathedral. We see a mixed crowd from which a shepherd\u2019s crook is shown protruding. In the front of the crowd a boy and girl can be seen on the green. They are all listening to Tyndale preaching. The caption below reads \"On College Green\u201d. At their rear we see the Cathedral itself. In the next light on the right and at the top a printer is shown at work under the symbol of an open book and he is being watched in his work by Tyndale who has a Bible in his hands. Behind these are the words Peter Quentel, and on a table in front a pile of papers waits for printing. The caption reads \u201cPrinting the New Testament.\u201d In the next scene, the second down on the left, we see Tyndale about to board a boat moored at the quayside with sheets of paper in hand. A sailor in the boat is pulling the rigging. Beneath are the words \"Saving half-printed sheets\u201d. In the middle panel of the centre light and over the words \"WILLIAM TYNDALE 1490-1536\" we see Tyndale himself. He stands erect and clutching the Scriptures. In the next light to the right and in the middle of the right hand light we see Bishop Tunstall at St Paul's. He stands in a pulpit preaching and before him on the ground is a pile of New Testaments burning. A naked flame rises skywards. and a mixed crowd watch and listen. The caption reads \"Bishop Tunstall at St Paul's\". Next in the bottom row of the left hand light and with the caption \u201cPhillips betrays him\u201d, a man reaches out toward Tyndale. Two men are brandishing weapons, one an axe and the other a lance or spear. They are arresting him. In the lower scene of the middle light and in a darkened cell with the night sky visible through the barred window and with a single light for illumination, we see Tyndale sitting at a table, a book propped up in front of him, writing in another book. The caption reads \u201cTyndale works in prison\u201d. Finally, in the lower part of the right hand light, we see a fiercely burning fire being stoked by executioners with a rake and one flame rises skyward. In the centre of this the lifeless body of William Tyndale can be seen. Underneath are the words \"Tyndale\u2019s body is burned\". Across the lower panes are the words \"As a city set on a hill cannot be hid even so the light of Christ\u2019s gospel may not be hid as though it pertained to some certain holy persons only\". Apart from the Tyndale and Bunyan windows, Robinson completed three double windows for the church. These are in the chancel behind the communion table and the baptistery and on each of them Robinson depicts biblical images in order to focus attention on the Life, Ministry, Death and Resurrection of Our Lord, with opening images depicting the creation and the giving of the Law. In the first double window, one light shows Adam and Eve with Cain and Abel. They stand in front of a tree in whose branches we see a coiled snake. Adam is busy digging and Eve holds in her hands what appears to be some sort of utensil. Some plants grow at their feet. In the right hand light of this first window Moses holds a scroll of the Law. A halo surrounds his head from which rays of light are emitted. In the next double window the light on the left shows Mary, the mother of Jesus. She kneels before the Baby Jesus who lies in a crib. Joseph stands behind her holding a lamp and behind him we see the head of a cow. Above them Robinson paints a cross-shaped structure and a little higher is an Angel who gazes down and over the word \u201cEmmanuel.\u201d In the right hand light Jesus stands in a boat preaching to some disciples, two of whom kneel and gaze up at him in adoration. Another man appears to be running away. In the third and final window Robinson depicts the crucifixion in the right hand light with Roman soldiers playing dice at Our Lord\u2019s Feet and in the left hand light the Resurrection is depicted. We see a large figure of Christ, dressed in a white robe with a golden outer garment. He dwarfes the empty tomb which He has left and besides Him we see a tree starting to grow. Three Roman soldiers sleep at the bottom of the picture. The church also has a War Memorial window by Arnold Wathen Robinson dating to 1955 which features St John the Divine and David. It was St John the Divine who wrote the Book of Revelation, whose visionary passages contain several references to wars and fighting (e.g. the Battle of Armageddon). At one point, war breaks out in heaven between the Archangel Michael and the \"great dragon\", the devil. In Robinson\u2019s window, Michael is depicted as having slain the dragon, and over the head of the picture are the words \"And there shall be no more death\" (Rev. 12:7-8). In the other picture, we see the boy David, just after his encounter with Goliath, sling still in his hand, and his pouch, which had contained stones, slung over his shoulder. At his feet is the head of the giant upside down on the ground! The words of Psalm 37:15 are quoted \u201c Their sword shall enter their own heart\u201d and a smaller circular window beneath this depicts David slaying a lion. (1 Samuel 17:34-37). A picture of Noah\u2019s ark is shown in the apex of the window. Robinson intended the theme of this window as \"Triumph through Adversity.\" In addition to the names of the three Robinson brothers who died in the fighting, two other men of the church are also recorded: Arnold St John Leger Kerry and Alfred Rutherford Whitewright. There is another window, adjacent to the war memorial window and painted in 1960, which is a memorial to Arnold Robinson himself. It was executed by Arnold Robinson's two children, Geoffrey and Daphne, and given to the church by them and Arnold\u2019s wife Constance. The window features St John the Baptist, chosen as the last of the prophets and St Stephen, chosen as the first of the martyrs. In a plain panel are the words \"ARNOLD WATHEN ROBINSON MASTER GLASS PAINTER 1888-1955\" Its theme is the ministry and mission of Jesus. This is signified by two figures representing the beginning and the \u2018end\u2019 of this. The figure of John the Baptist dominates this window. His right hand is raised in blessing and in his left, he holds a staff. His clothing of camel\u2019s hair, with the leather belt over his shoulder, complemented by the bushy beard, convey the fierceness of his character. But the lamb which lingers around his legs, reflects his words when Jesus came to meet him, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world\u201d (John 1:29). Over John\u2019s head are the words \u201cHe shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost\u201d. At his feet are the words \u201cSt John Baptist\u201d. Beneath this, is a circular light, depicting a kneeling Jesus, immediately before John baptizes him. A light from heaven shines down on him. The figure of Stephen stands alongside John, the first follower of Jesus to give his life for his faith, thus expressing the fulfilment of what Jesus came to achieve. In a small circlet, Stephen is shown appearing before the high priest (Acts 7:1ff). In the larger picture, Stephen preaches a sermon, tracing the history of the Hebrew people repeatedly opposing God and rejecting the prophets whom God sent to them. On the ground are the stones or rocks which his hearers threw at him. In the background is the city of Jerusalem, its towers red with anger, the colour of blood. Above are Stephen\u2019s words \u201cBehold I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\u201d In the apex of the window is a symbolic representation of this. The words beneath are a quotation from the (Apocrypha \u201cEcclesiasticus 41.13\") \u201cA good life hath a few days, but a good name endureth for ever\". Geoffrey Robinson has a second window in the church which he executed in 1970. It is entitled \"Sickness and Suffering\". It features the suffering of Job and of the woman suffering from haemorrhages who touched the hem of Jesus's garment. At the base of the window are the words \"Through pain and suffering give glory to him.\" It was given by an anonymous donor, who paid for it herself and chose the theme. It is a two-light window and on the left is Job, the Old Testament character who suffered a long series of misfortunes and tragedies. These culminated in a dreadful illness which brought out \u201csore boils\u201d covering him \u201cfrom the soles of his feet to his crown\u201d. These are graphically depicted on all the exposed parts of his body. Yet his faith remains serene. Above him are his words as he kneels in prayer \u201cBlessed be the name of the Lord\u201d. (Job 1:21). In the other light is the woman suffering from haemorrhages who touched Jesus\u2019s robe. The view we see of him is his back, but as she touches him, startled, he turns and looks behind him, asking \u201cWho touched me?\u201d(Mark 5:30). His disciples are astonished at his question. Above the picture are the words \u201cIf I may but touch his garment, I shall be made whole\u201d. Beneath is his response \u201cThy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d Under this picture are two smaller ones depicting the work of the modern healing profession. They are now of course dated as the equipment, technology and dress reflect the times when the picture was executed., Nevertheless the principle remains valid. In one circle, a blood transfusion is shown in progress, and in the other, an operation. In the apex of each light is a symbol of healing: on the left a pestle and mortar, and on the right a cadeucus. The latter is an ancient symbol traditionally worn as a kind of charm, signifying healing. Tyndale Baptist Church does indeed contain some superb Robinson stained glass and images of the \u201cTyndale\u201d and \u201cBunyan\u201d windows are shown below and some further images appear in the \"Gallery\".[1] \u201cThere is a memorial window to him in Tyndale Baptist Church but really, all his windows are a memorial to this most talented of men\" Words written by Arnold Robinson\u2019s son, Geoffrey.", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "Wills Memorial Building", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Bristol", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol"]}, {"text": "", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Robinson had made the original \u201cFounder\u2019s window\u201d in the university's main building\u2019s entrance hall, this to a design by D.
