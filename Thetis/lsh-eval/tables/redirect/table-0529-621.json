Serving as a blocking element to deny hostile forces approach routes into Saigon and portions of Binh Chanh District, Company D and attached units repeatedly displayed outstanding acts of valor against superior forces in offensive, defensive, and ambush operations. During the period nine major contacts were made with elements of four North Vietnamese Army battalions and in each instance the enemy forces were routed from the battlefield by the aggressive action, teamwork, firepower, spirit, heroism, and outstanding tactics of the combined arms team. Maintaining pressure on the enemy forces to prevent their withdrawal, Company D dispersed and demoralized the units and prevented their reorganization, while killing 181 North Vietnamese Army soldiers and capturing ten prisoners of war, numerous weapons, equipment, and ammunition. Throughout the prolonged period of savage fighting the men of Company D by their relentless determination, undaunted courage and aggressive spirit performed countless acts of heroism as they defeated enemy forces with numerically superior automatic weapons, small arms, mortar and rocket fire.

Operating in an area bordered by over 200 miles of South China Sea coastline, the mountainous Laotian border and the Demilitarized Zone, the Third Marine Division (Reinforced) successfully executed eighty major combat operations, carrying the battle to the enemy, destroying many of his forces, and capturing thousands of tons of weapons and material. In addition to these major operations, more than 125,000 offensive counterguerrilla actions, ranging from squad patrols and ambushes to company-sizes search and destroy operations, were conducted in both the coastal rice lands and the mountainous jungle inland. These bitterly contested actions routed the enemy from his well-entrenched positions, denied him access to his source of food, restricted his freedom of movement, and removed his influence from the heavily populated areas. In numerous operations, the Third marine Division (Reinforced) demonstrated the great efficacy of combined operations with units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In July 1966, the Third marine Division (Reinforced) moved to the north to counter major elements of the North Vietnamese Army moving across the Demilitarized Zone into the Province of Quang Tri; its units fought a series of savage battles against the enemy, repeatedly distinguishing themselves and, time and again, forcing the enemy to retreat across the Demilitarized Zone. Imbued with an unrelenting combat spirit and initiative and undeterred by heavy hostile artillery and mortar fire, extremely difficult terrain, incessant heat and monsoon rains, the Third marine Division (Reinforced), employing courageous ground, heliborne and amphibious assaults, complemented by intense and accurate air, artillery and naval gunfire support, inflicted great losses on the enemy and denied him the political and militart victory he sought to achieve at any cost.

During this hectic, 35-day campaign, the MRF played a vital role in driving the enemy out of My Tho and Vinh Long, the most severely ravaged of all the Delta cities, and in preventing enemy forces from launching sustained attacks on Can Tho, Binh Thuy, Sa Dec, Cai Be, Cai Lay, the Army Base at Dong Tam, and many other less-populated areas. In every battle, MRF personnel, both individually and collectively, although often matched against forces of much greater size than their own, displayed outstanding courage and professionalism in subduing the Viet Cong challenge. Navy crewmen embarked in Monitors, Command and Communication Boats, Assault Support Patrol Boats, and Armored Troop Carriers were frequently ambushed at point-blank range from concealed positions along both banks of the narrow, jungle-enshrouded Delta streams.
