Participating in the operations which preceded and supported the Allied breakthrough at Cassino, Italy, the 320th Bombardment Group, displaying extraordinary accuracy in effectively bombarding rail and highway bridges, troop concentrations, airfields nd shipping, repeatedly dropped all its bombs within 200 yards of pinpoint targets. On 12 May 1944, in direct support of the Fifth Army's advance along the coastal highway toward Rome, the 320th Bombardment Group achieved spectacular results in an attack on heavily defended enemy troop concentrations,including the famed 15th Panzer Grenadier Division, bivouaced near Fondi. At 1330 hours, thirty six B-26 Marauder aircraft of the 320th Bombardment Group took off from their Sardinian Base and made landfall southeast of Sperlonga, Italy. Displaying superior flying skills and extraordinary heroism,the group pilots steadfastly held their flights intact through heavy and accurate anit-aircraft fire which tracked them from landfall to the target and back to the coast. So deadly was the hostile fire that,notwithstanding, the most skillfull employment of vigorous evasive action,seventeen of their bombers were damaged and several crew members wounded.Rsolutely continuing on a long, deliberate bomb run despite the intense barage,determined pilots,expertly holding their unescorted Marauders in a superbly coordinated formation, enabled the bombers to release 3,978 fragmentation bombs with unerring precision. The concentrated pattern which blanketed the target area inflicted irreplaceable casualties and destruction upon the already hard pressed enemy, smashing this key concentration of reserves and rendering incalculable aid to the Allied ground forces in their drive northward, The outstanding results achieved which set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement are typical of the continuously superior precision bpmbing of the 320th Bombardment Group, and were possibly only through remarkable leadership, unstinted effort and superlative performance of duty by every member of the organization. Through their unsurpassed courage,skill in combat and steadfast devotion of duty, the personnel of the 320th Bombardment Group have reflected great credit upon themselves and the Military Service of the United States.

For outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy in the European Theater of Operations on March 15, 1945. In direct coordination with the Allied Offensive against the enemy ground forces in the Saar-Palatinate, the Seventh Army was ordered to attack directly through the strongly fortified Seigfried Line along a front east of Zweibrucken, Germany; the objective of this Marauder Group was to effectively blanket hostile pillboxes, and tank obstructions with heavy demolition bombs to sufficiently weaken that much vaunted line, enabling the ground forces to break through the enemy positions. Despite accurate anti-aircraft fire from the Seigfried defenses, the 320th Bombardment Group released a devastatingly accurate concentration of bombs to create inestimable damage to installations and personnel. The conspicuous part played by this group set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement and insured the success of these operations. Beginning at 0630 hours, on March 15, 1945, five waves of nineteen B-26 aircraft of the 320th Bombardment Group took off from this French base. Despite persistent and accurate ground fire, the Marauders resolutely persevered on unwavering axes of attack to execute long deliberate and flawless bomb runs releasing 1340 high explosives in perfect patterns within the assigned coordinates despite heavy ground haze, inflicting irreplaceable casualties upon the enemy personnel. After photographs revealed pillboxes, communication trenches, weapons pits and roads devastated within the target area with such effect that the Seventh Army made its initial breakthrough of the Seigfried Line with virtually no opposition over the areas attacked by the 320th Bombardment Group. This perfectly executed endeavor of air-ground coordination was carried through to its highly successful conclusion by a complete coverage of heavy, visibly limiting, ground haze. This was accomplished by the remarkable leadership of perfectly teamed pilot-bombardier combinations thoroughly trained in the revolutionary technique on non-visual Shoran bombing and the constantly proficient contributions of all personnel in this Marauder Group. This Operation is typical of the superior bombing of the 320th Bombardment Group, has reflected the greatest credit upon the Group and the Armed Service of the United States.

While en route to the target the second box of B-26 airplanes, which was without fighter escort and was separated by several miles from the first box, was viciously attacked by from 15 to 25 Messerschmitt aircraft. Despite the determined defensive fire which took a large toll of the hostile fighters, the enemy pressed his attacks with such fury that the low flight was overpowered and four B-26 aircraft were forced down in flames. Although in the ensuing encounters every airplane in the remaining two flights sustained damage from the enemy attacks, the gallant airmen succeeded in driving four of the enemy airplanes to certain destruction and forcing four more to break away in flames. Meanwhile the first box pressed on to the target despite intermittent flank and the imminence of fighter attack. Although a pathfinder failure occurred 1 minute before bomb-release time, the bombardiers synchronized on the target with such accuracy that extensive damage was inflicted on the bridge. Notwithstanding the heavy losses incurred during the enemy attacks the second box returned for an additional run on the target, and as a result of their determined efforts the central portion of the bridge span was completely destroyed. Despite the severe damage inflicted on the group's aircraft during the morning mission, the officers and men of the 387th Bombardment Group displayed great determination in embarking on another mission only 2 hours after the bombers had returned to base. A withering hail of antiaircraft fire was encountered over the target area at Prum, Germany, which damaged 21 of the 26 airplanes dispatched. In the face of this sustained barrage of flak the courageous airmen released their bombs with a high degree of accuracy upon the communications installations.

Following the Rhine River crossings made on a large scale by allied Armies, the 42nd United States Infantry Divisions arrived at the out skirts of the fortress city of Schweinfurt, Germany, an important communications center. With its advance towards Nuremberg and Munich impeded by numerous strong points in this city, which constituted one of the principle German held defense bastions, it was necessary to neutralize Schweinfurt by air bombardment. The magnificent air cooperation provided the 42nd Division by the 42nd bombardment Wing on this noteworthy occasion is an eloquent tribute to the effectiveness of air ground coordination and teamwork. The preeminent part played by the 17th Bombardment Group set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement and insured the effectiveness of these operations as a whole. After taking off from their base at Dijon, France, at 09.15 hours on 10 April 1945, sixty-eight B-26 aircraft from the Group commenced their bombing run near the objective amid a barrage of heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire which damaged fifteen of the attacking Marauders. The twelve flights of bombers resolutely persevered on their course over the target in perfect formation and accomplished the bombing with incredible precision. Photo reconnaissance revealed that the 133 tons of bombs released on the objective by the 17th Bombardment Group achieved unparalleled destruction. Such extensive damage was inflicted upon the city by blast and fire that the military effectiveness of the enemy troops defending the city was paralyzed. The success of the mission, so typical of the superior bombing of the 17th Bombardment Group, was so catastrophic for the enemy that the 42nd Division was able to seize Schweinfurt with virtually no opposition, thereby accelerating the advance of the Seventh Army towards Nuremberg and Munich, thus bringing to a more rapid conclusion the ultimate victory of the Allies. The thoroughness of the mission planning and the precision of the execution attests to the efficiency, \u00e9lan, and determination of the combat crews. The superior results achieved are attributable to the extensive cooperation and devotion to duty displayed by the ground crews and the administration staffs who made possible such an exceptional achievement. The enormous damage inflicted upon the enemy installations by the 17th Bombardment Group in the Mediterranean and European Theater of Operations, during a period of twenty-nine consecutive months of air warfare was accomplished by a consistently high bombing accuracy which is believed to be without precedent. Through its unique and highly successful performance against the enemy in six hundred and six bombing missions, the 17th Bombardment Group has won for itself an enviable position in the Army Air Forces which reflected the greatest credit upon the Group conforming to the most illustrious traditions of the United States military service.

The initial purpose of this attack was to destroy the important plant, capable of producing two hundred and fifty ME 109's monthly. A successful completion of the mission would cost the enemy 8 to 9 months of production and would materially diminish Nazi interception of allied strategic bombing on the continent.
