He then orders her to leave his domain, which she begrudgingly does, but not before an emotional departing with Bill outside. Lorena returns in season 3 when Bill is captured by Russell Edgington. At the time, she appears to have been living as a guest in Russell's mansion. Upon seeing Lorena, Bill becomes enraged and hurls a lamp at her, engulfing her in flames, but she survives. Russell leaves Bill to Lorena and though at first Bill resists her advances, the two end up having violent sex, and he twists her neck 180 degrees. After this he calls Sookie and ends their relationship though he does so only to protect Sookie and delude Lorena into believing he has returned to her. Eventually Bill's deception becomes apparent and she resolves to kill him per instructions from Russell. She spends a lengthy and very emotional time torturing him in the servants' house on the mansion grounds before allowing werewolves to feed on his blood. When Sookie escapes from Russell and bursts into the room to save Bill, Lorena attacks her, but Sookie gets the upper hand and plunges a piece of wood into Lorena's chest, killing her.", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "Patrick Devins", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Scott Foley", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Foley"]}, {"text": "5", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood_(season_5)"]}, {"text": "4", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood_(season_4)"]}, {"text": "9", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "4th of July", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)"]}, {"text": "4th of July", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)"]}, {"text": "4th of July", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)"]}, {"text": "4th of July", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)"]}, {"text": "4th of July", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)"]}], [{"text": "Adele Stackhouse", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Lois Smith", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Smith"]}, {"text": "1", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood_(season_1)"]}, {"text": "4", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood_(season_4)"]}, {"text": "8", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "Cheyenne Wilbur", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Cheyenne Wilbur", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Cheyenne Wilbur", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Cheyenne Wilbur", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Cheyenne Wilbur", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "Truman Burrell", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "Arliss Howard", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arliss_Howard"]}, {"text": "6", "isNumeric": false, "links": ["http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood_(season_6)"]}, {"text": "-", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "6", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "Truman Burrell is the Governor of Louisiana.
