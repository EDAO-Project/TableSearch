While investigating the haunting, Dean and Sam relive their high school experiences through flashbacks, recalling how Sam was picked on by the school bully while Dean was Mr. Popular. Initially, they believe it to be the ghost of a friend of Sam's who killed himself the year after they left, but when the ghost attacks Sam and calls him by name even after they burn the bones, they realize it's someone else. They learn that the ghost haunts the bus and possesses people there and realize the bus driver is the father of the kid who bullied Sam, Dirk. Sam beat him in a fist-fight before they left the school and gave him the nickname \"Dirk the Jerk.\" The brothers learn from Dirk's father that he died at age 18 before graduation and that he lived a hard life, losing his mother shortly before Sam met him and gaining a lot of anger as a result. He got picked on a lot and kids called him \"Dirk the Jerk.\" After learning that Dirk was cremated and that he is tied to a lock of hair kept on the bus, Sam and Dean confront Dirk while he possesses two people and Dean burns his hair, destroying Dirk's spirit.
