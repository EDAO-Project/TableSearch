Much to Ackland's annoyance, she takes Carver with her, and they have words. Spears tells Ackland to take it up with Chandler. But word is getting around that Spears gets special treatment from the boss. When a number of cameras are damaged, two youths who have threatened one of the operators, Pat Spencer, are suspected, but the culprit turns out to be Robert Slade, whom the youths call \"weird\". Then Spears discovers Robert lives in community care and thinks the cameras are spying on him. Robert spends a lot of his time in an internet caf and tells Hollis about his homepage, where Hollis sees a picture Robert has taken of a shopping centre security guard, Tony Malone.
