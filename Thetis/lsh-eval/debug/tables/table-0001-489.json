To carry high current, BJTs must have relatively large base currents, thus these devices have high power losses when compared to MOSFET devices. BJTs along with MOSFETs, are also considered unipolar and do not block reverse voltage very well, unless installed in pairs with protection diodes. Generally, BJTs are not utilized in power electronics switching circuits because of the I 2 R losses associated with on resistance and base current requirements. BJTs have lower current gains in high power packages, thus requiring them to be set up in Darlington configurations in order to handle the currents required by power electronic circuits. Because of these multiple transistor configurations, switching times are in the hundreds of nanoseconds to microseconds.

Since the MOSFET is a depletion channel device, voltage, not current, is necessary to create a conduction path from drain to source. The gate does not contribute to either drain or source current. Turn on gate current is essentially zero with the only power dissipated at the gate coming during switching. Losses in MOSFETs are largely attributed to on-resistance. The calculations show a direct correlation to drain source on-resistance and the device blocking voltage rating, BV dss . Switching times range from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred microseconds, depending on the device. MOSFET drain source resistances increase as more current flows through the device. As frequencies increase the losses increase as well, making BJTs more attractive. Power MOSFETs can be paralleled in order to increase switching current and therefore overall switching power. Nominal voltages for MOSFET switching devices range from a few volts to a little over 1000V, with currents up to about 100A or so. Newer devices may have higher operational characteristics.
