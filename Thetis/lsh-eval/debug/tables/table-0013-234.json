Meanwhile, in space, Greenbeard's ship has fallen apart whilst in the middle of stealing jewels from the planet Pacula. Greenbeard demands to find a new ship, and arrives on Earth at the theme park. As Betty and her family settle in on going into a waterslide with a pirate ship, Greenbeard also sets his sights on it to use as his new ship. Seeing Greenbeard, Betty attempts to corral her parents to safety, but Betty's parents believe Greenbeard and his crew are park employees putting on a show. As Betty retreats to find Sparky, Greenbeard takes Betty's parents hostage after hearing about Betty's mother's snacks, which were termed \"gold bars\". Taking the ship and Betty's parents with them, Greenbeard leaves Earth for Pacula to make another attempt at the jewels. After refusing to hand over the \"gold bars\", Greenbeard attempts to keelhaul Betty's parents, but they are saved by Sparky, who had been on the ride when Greenbeard had hijacked the ship. Betty, her parents, and Sparky return to the deck of the ship just as Greenbeard discovers that there are too many jewels to steal, and the ship cannot hold them all. After an explosion occurs on the ship caused by having too many jewels, Greenbeard attempts to steal the \"gold bars\" again as a consolation prize, but he and his crew are quickly dispatched by Betty, her parents, and Sparky (Betty's father taking photos as the other three were doing the fighting). However, they are unable to control the ship, as it drifts at high speed towards Earth. However, thanks to X-5's invention (a motorized pinwheel), the ship is able to reenter Earth's atmosphere safely, and the ship lands back at the amusement park. (Villain: Captain Greenbeard) Rodeo Robots: Betty and her crew is with her uncle Charlie, where they are enjoying the Moose Jaw Heights Rodeo. Sparky is ecstatic, not because he has never been to a rodeo, but because of the prospects of food. When Charlie asks Betty and company if they want to ride a horse, Sparky insists on riding the untamable horse, Thunderbolt. Meanwhile, Dr. Cerebral has arrived at Crushton, intent on finding spare parts for his latest scheme to destroy Atomic Betty. He discovers a robot remote control, which he dismisses, before discovering Robo-Betty, helping B-1 restore his space cruiser. Robo-Betty is abducted by Cerebral, and leads him to Galactic Guardian Headquarters. Back at the rodeo, Admiral DeGill, also at the rodeo, gets word of Robo-Betty's abduction and orders Betty to stop Cerebral. While distracted by Chaz, Betty and X-5 are discovered by Cerebral. As Betty escapes Cerebral's gunfire, X-5 tries to confront Robo-Betty, only to be kicked onto Sparky, still riding Thunderbolt. X-5 manages to tame Thunderbolt, and the two of them together return to assist Betty. Meanwhile, while Robo-Betty has a temporary malfunction after she meets Chaz, Betty has gained the upper hand on Cerebral. However, this would not last: as Cerebral accidentally throws out a rubber snake that he had won from inadvertently being knocked into a carnival game, it spooks Sparky and X-5 off Thunderbolt, knocking the two on Betty and allowing Robo-Betty to tie the three up. Strapping Betty and her crew on a rocket-powered steer, Cerebral and Robo-Betty celebrate their victory in front of a grandstand full of fans just as B-1 arrives from Crushton. B-1 manages to use a tow line to stop the steer, but Robo-Betty manages to knock B-1 out of his cruiser. B-1 confronts Robo-Betty directly, causing Cerebral's remote control to wear off. Robo-Betty destroys the remote control herself, just as Betty and her crew free themselves, with Thunderbolt's assistance.
